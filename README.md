Random Game

To create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the userâ€™s choice and then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the random module in Python from a list of choices, and if the user wins then the score will increase by 1.
Creating these types of games will help a beginner to think logically. You can even use this idea to make your own game. In the end, creating these types of programs will help you create your algorithms, which is a very important skill for coding interviews and competitive programming.
